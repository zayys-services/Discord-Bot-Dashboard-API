# Discord Bot Dashboard With An API
I am developing a Discord bot dashboard with an API, please note this project is not near done, but we are working hard to get it released to you guys!

## Features
- Modern dashboard with categories [editable via code]
- Safe API, just change the API key.

## My setup
I have this setup right in my house behind cloudflare tunnels, one server with Cloudpanel and the other with Pterodactyl panel, all you gotta do it learn how to set those up and you'll be ready! We will have a guide when the program actually works for this.

- API on Pterodactyl Node.JS
- Frontend on Cloudpanel static HTML
- Both proxied behind Cloudflared tunnels

## Problems
This is the very first release, so don't expect it to work, because it won't! I am working hard on getting this to work, but it takes time! We have the API working for some things and are working on more!

Just wait until this page gets updated to a release!
