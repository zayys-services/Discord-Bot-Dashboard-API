Please note you must install these modules below:

express cors body-parser fs cookie-parser sqlite3

Also note when starting the bot it expects an post to the API to update the Discord bot users, servers, and ping!

It will create multiple files:

data.db
users.json

We are working on making it work with a .env, but right now we care about it working in general.
